## Introduction
Our paper propose a Multi-Direction Convolution and Transformer Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation (MCNet) by integrating multi-direction convolution and transformer together. The
MCNet employs a dual-branch encoder ,and a Transformer as the bottleneck, to capture the
multi-directional features and the global features, respectively.
In addition, we design two modules, the Convolution and
Wavelet Fusion module (CWF) and the Feature Enhancement
module (FE), to better fuse the features of the two encoders
and enhance the decoderâ€™s feature expression ability.
