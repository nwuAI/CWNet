## Introduction
Our paper propose a Convolution and Wavelet Cooperated CNN-transformer architecture for Retinal Vessel Segmentation (CWNet) by integrating convolution, wavelet and transformer together. The
CWNet employs a dual-branch encoder ,and a Transformer as the bottleneck, to capture the
multi-directional features and the global features, respectively.
In addition, we design two modules, the Convolution and
Wavelet Fusion module (CWF) and the Feature Enhancement
module (FE), to better fuse the features of the two encoders
and enhance the decoderâ€™s feature expression ability.
