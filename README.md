## Introduction
Our paper propose a Multi-Direction Convolution and Transformer Cooperated Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation (CWNet) by integrating multi-direction convolution and transformer together. The
CWNet employs a dual-branch encoder, and a Transformer as the bottleneck, to capture the
multi-directional features and the global features, respectively.
In addition, we design two modules, the Convolution and
Wavelet Fusion module (CWF) and the Feature Enhancement
module (FE), to better integrate the features of the two branches of the encoder and the features of the encoder and
decoder, and enhance the decoderâ€™s feature expression ability.
